## Getting Started

2. In your terminal, run `npm install`.
3. In your terminal, run `npm test`.
4. Edit `script.js` until you are passing all test cases!
5. _(Optional)_ You can change `describe(...)` to `describe.only(...)` in `script_test.js` if you'd like to run only the tests for the problem you're working on.
6. Type `Control+C` in your terminal to close the Mocha process once you are done testing.
